Every field of human endeavor is infused with the question, "who am I, who are you and they, what are these things 
around us and how did it all came to be?" The field of Emergence, in a sense, attempts to answer this queston from Science and 
Philosophy. Where science ends and philosophy begins in this topic, is itself a major question of study. 

One can see that these are also questions in religion and spirituality and therefore, the field of emergence can be of great 
interest to a wide variety of practitioners.

Emergence is what happens when an assembly of functioning parts has complexity with multiple levels of interactions and at some 
critical point, the assembly acquires properties that are incommensurate- its behavior is not found in its parts and cannot be reduced to the 
sum of the behavior of its parts.
