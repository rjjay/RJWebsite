Moderation:
Yes, I do believe n moderation in behavior, want, deed and reaction. But, like anything else, the term moderation
demands further definition or context. It often depends on who is judging. 
Then there are things which are, indeed, 
binary-black & white. A lion killing its prey, a man winning the race, a phase change in a critical phenomenon or a person having true faith. 

There is a much closer definition in science of health and environment. A certain level of LDL-C or blood dugar or obesity index
is a measure, an increase of CO2 over certain value defined by statistically relevant damage to earth systems etc. Until, we establish 
those lasting and scientific standards, it would be hard to justify moderation on its own in sociology and in common expectation.
